# todo/

Plans for work that is **not finished**. Documentation of the system as it *is* belongs in `research/`.

The test is one question: **is someone still supposed to build this?** If yes it lives here; once it ships,
the plan moves to `research/` with its status changed to `IMPLEMENTED <date>` and its deviations recorded.

Every plan starts with a status line on line 2–3 and carries: the symptom or goal before any solution,
references to real code as `file.rs:line` (verified, not guessed), a build order, a test plan, and a
Definition of Done.

## Currently open

| plan | status | scope |
|---|---|---|
| [PLAN_sidecar_product.md](PLAN_sidecar_product.md) | engine works and is measured on an R9700; distribution is not built | build recipe as data, self-verification against a reference vector, public-repository hygiene, host ergonomics |

## The constraint that shapes every plan here

The execution provider is a **compile-time** feature, and the vendor providers — DirectML, NVIDIA CUDA and
cuDNN — are licensed such that we may use them and must never redistribute them. One cached copy in a
registry, an image layer or an offline bundle makes us a redistributor.

So there is no fat binary that works everywhere, and no plan here should propose one. The customer's machine
builds what it needs, and the product drives that build.

## Sibling repositories

- `dew_flow_rag_qln` — the product that drives the build and consumes the vectors (private)
- `dew_flow_mcp` — the tool surface those vectors eventually answer through (public)
