## The rule

Every host — a web app, a worker, a CLI, an AppHost — writes its logs to **two destinations, always**:

1. **The console, in colour**, so the Aspire dashboard renders levels and structure instead of grey text.
2. **A file on disk**, under a folder named for the day, with a **new file per host run**.

There is no third mode and no "production turns the file off". A log that only exists in a terminal buffer is
gone the moment the window closes, which is reliably the moment someone needs it.

### Path shape

```
logs/{yyyy-MM-dd}/{app}-{HH-mm-ss}-{pid}.log
```

- **A folder per day**, so a week of work is seven directories rather than one listing nobody scrolls.
- **A file per RUN**, not per day. This is the part people get wrong by reaching for a rolling sink: rolling
  by day appends every run into one file, and the question actually being asked is almost always "what did
  *that* run do". The timestamp is taken once at startup; the pid disambiguates two hosts started in the same
  second (an AppHost starting several children does exactly that).
- `logs/` is git-ignored in every repo.
- **Everything is UTC** — the folder, the file name, and the timestamp on every line. Not a preference: the
  Rust sidecar has no timezone library and names its folder from a unix timestamp, so a local-time .NET host
  and a UTC sidecar put the same evening's logs into two different day folders, and the one time anyone
  correlates them is while chasing a failure across both. One clock, everywhere.

### Colour: Serilog's console theme does NOT work here — measured

**Do not use `WriteTo.Console(theme: …)` for the coloured sink.** It emits nothing once stdout is
redirected, and an orchestrator capturing a child's output redirects stdout by definition — so the theme
produces colour when you run the host by hand and grey text in the dashboard, which is the one place the
colour was for.

Measured on **Serilog.Sinks.Console 6.1.1**, escape bytes counted on a redirected stream:

| configuration | escapes |
|---|---|
| `theme: AnsiConsoleTheme.Code, applyThemeToRedirectedOutput: true` | **0** |
| `theme: AnsiConsoleTheme.Sixteen, applyThemeToRedirectedOutput: true` | **0** |
| `Serilog.Expressions` `ExpressionTemplate` with `TemplateTheme.Code` | **0** |
| a control writing one escape by hand, same process | **4** |

The control is what makes the result trustworthy: the measurement pipeline preserves escapes, the sink
simply does not write them. `applyThemeToRedirectedOutput` is a documented flag that changes nothing in this
version.

**So the coloured console sink is ours** — see `AnsiConsoleSink` in any repo's `ServiceDefaults`. About forty
lines that write the escapes unconditionally. Colour only the level strongly; a line where everything is
coloured is a line where nothing stands out.

Render the message through Serilog's own `MessageTemplateTextFormatter` with `{Message:lj}`, never
`LogEvent.RenderMessage()` — the latter quotes every string property, so a connection failure reads
``database '"qln"'``.

The file sink gets no colour: escape codes in a file are noise to every reader, `grep` included.

### stdio hosts write console logs to STDERR

An MCP server on the stdio transport uses **stdout for the protocol**. One log line on stdout corrupts the
JSON-RPC stream, and the failure looks like a protocol bug rather than a logging one. Any host with a stdio
mode sends its console sink to stderr; the file sink is unaffected.

### What every line carries

Machine-readable enough to grep, short enough to read:

```
[HH:mm:ss LVL] {SourceContext}: message {Properties}
```

Plus, as enrichers on every event: the application name and the process id. Two hosts writing into one
terminal is the normal case under an orchestrator, and a line that cannot say which one wrote it is a line
that has to be traced by guessing.

### Levels come from configuration, never from call sites

`MinimumLevel` and per-source overrides live in `appsettings.json` under `Serilog:`. Changing verbosity is a
config edit and a restart — never an edited call site, never a rebuilt binary. Default floor is
`Information`, with `Microsoft.AspNetCore` and `System.Net.Http.HttpClient` at `Warning`: request and
handler chatter drowns the application's own story at Information.

### Failures during startup must still be logged

Configure Serilog **before** the host is built, and wrap the run in `try/catch/finally` with
`Log.CloseAndFlush()`. A host that crashes while wiring itself up is precisely when the log matters, and a
logger configured after `Build()` has nothing to say about it.

## The shape (C#)

One project per repo, named `<Repo>.ServiceDefaults`, exposing one extension. Never configure Serilog in more
than one place in a repo.

```csharp
public static class <Repo>Logging
{
    public static void AddDewFlowLogging(this IHostApplicationBuilder builder, string appName, bool consoleToStdErr = false);
}
```

Call it as the first statement after creating the builder:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.AddDewFlowLogging("daemon");
```

## Rust

The sidecar has no Serilog; it has `tracing`, and the CONTRACT is what is shared, not the library:

- an stdout layer **with** ANSI (`.with_ansi(true)`),
- a file layer **without** ANSI, at the same `logs/{day}/{app}-{time}-{pid}.log` path,
- level from `RUST_LOG`, defaulting to the same floor.

## Never

- Never `Console.WriteLine` for anything that is a log. It has no level, no timestamp, no source, and it
  cannot be filtered.
- Never a rolling-by-day file sink for host logs — it merges runs, which is the opposite of the requirement.
- Never a `SystemConsoleTheme` — it silently drops colour under an orchestrator.
- Never write logs to stdout in a process whose stdout carries a protocol.
- Never configure logging inside a library. Libraries take `ILogger<T>` and say nothing about sinks.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] The repo has exactly one `AddDewFlowLogging` and every host calls it before `Build()`.
- [ ] Console output is coloured through an ANSI theme, and is visible as colour in the Aspire dashboard.
- [ ] A run produces `logs/{yyyy-MM-dd}/{app}-{HH-mm-ss}-{pid}.log`, and a second run produces a second file.
- [ ] A stdio host's console sink goes to stderr.
- [ ] Levels are configured in `appsettings.json`, not in code.
- [ ] `logs/` is git-ignored.
- [ ] **A new repository copies this file into its own `.claude/rules/common/` and is added to the mirror
      list below** — that is the whole reason this is a rule and not a comment in one `Program.cs`.

## Mirrors

| Repository | Kind | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `dew_flow_rag_qln` | .NET | **canonical copy** — change it here first |
| `dew_flow_mcp` | .NET | mirrored |
| `dew_flow_sidecar_rust` | Rust | mirrored (the Rust section governs) |
| `dew_flow_benchmark` | .NET, no projects yet | mirrored — applies to the first host it gains |

The previous-generation `ClaudeRag` repository is **frozen**: read it for reference, never write to it. It
holds an older copy of this rule that will not be updated, so do not treat it as a source.
